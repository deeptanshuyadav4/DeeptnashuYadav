# Quant Projects 🚀

This repository contains beginner-friendly experiments in algorithmic and quantitative trading.  
I’m building these projects to learn financial modeling, backtesting, and trading strategy analysis.

`moving_average.py`:

- Plots both the price and SMA to visualize potential entry/exit points

### 📊 Sample Output
*(coming soon – will add chart screenshot once ready)*

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Rolling windows and SMA logic
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Financial plotting with matplotlib
